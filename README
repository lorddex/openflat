This software is released under GPLv3 license.

Do you share your flat with other people? Do you need a simple solution to manage all common costs and to trace how much money you spend?
FlatManager is the software that you need.
You can create one or more users, each of them can add his expenses and FlatManager automatically calculates statistics and how much money you have to give to any other flatmates.
Everything can be done using the webapp with your own username and password.
